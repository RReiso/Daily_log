## February 2021

**25/02/2021**: JS - learning about function parameters and arguments, for in and for of loops, practicing git.

TIL: Single threaded language - one call stack, one memory heap, executed code in order.

**26/02/2021**: Started building side-nav-bar using vanilla JS; learned about DOM - mouseenter event.

TIL: If you use arrow function, use "return" keyword. Window.getComputedStyle(element) - lists all styles currently applied on element.
